# weightlifting-calendar
A pseudo calendar GUI for weight lifting.    
This will keep track of what excercise you should do for each day including the sets, reps, and weight, as well as, any online guides you want.    
Adding, removing, editing days or workouts can all be done through the GUI.     
This project is build using tkinter with python 3. Executable and sample workout data are included in the repo.
